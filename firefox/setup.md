# Firefox Setup

To finish setting up Firefox, follow these instructions.

## Settings

Most settings should be covered by `user.js`, however some of these don't seem
to have an `about:config` record or I haven't been able to figure it out.

## General

* Set Firefox as your default browser

## Search

* Change Default Search Engine to _DuckDuckGo_.
* Remove all other One-Click Search Engines

## Privacy & Security

* Make sure _Do Not Track_ is set to `Always`

## Extensions

Installing add-ons can't easily be automated, so here is a list of add-ons I
use in Firefox sorted by category.
