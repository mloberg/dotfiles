# Firefox Setup

To finish setting up Firefox, follow these instructions.

## Settings

Make sure all `user.js` config settings got set. In [about:config](about:config)
make sure the value of `_user.js.parrot` is what you expect.

There are a few settings that need to be set manually.

### General

* Set Firefox as your default browser (this check is disabled by default)

### Search

* Change Default Search Engine to _DuckDuckGo_.
* Remove all other One-Click Search Engines

## Extensions

Installing add-ons can't easily be automated, so here is a list of add-ons I
use in Firefox sorted by category.
