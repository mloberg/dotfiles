This is how I like my system. You have different tastes and preferences, so
cloning this outright probably isn't what you want. However feel free to take
and modify any part of it to fit your needs.

## install

    git clone https://github.com/mloberg/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    ~/.dotfiles/script/mac

## one-line install (not recommended)

    bash <(curl -fsS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mloberg/dotfiles/master/script/mac)
