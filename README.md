# mloberg dotfiles

My dotfiles forked from [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles).

## components

There's a few special files in the hierarchy.

- **bin/**: Anything in `bin/` will get added to your `$PATH` and be made
  available everywhere.
- **Brewfile**: This is like a Gemfile for Homebrew.
- **topic/\*.bash**: Any files ending in `.bash` get loaded into your
  environment.
- **topic/path.bash**: Any file named `path.bash` is loaded first and is
  expected to setup `$PATH` or similar.
- **topic/completion.bash**: Any file named `completion.bash` is loaded
  last and is expected to setup autocomplete.
- **topic/install.sh**: Any file named `install.sh` is executed when you run
  `script/install`. To avoid being loaded automatically, its extension is `.sh`,
  not `.bash`.
- **topic/\*.symlink**: Any file ending in `*.symlink` gets symlinked into
  your `$HOME`. This is so you can keep all of those versioned in your dotfiles
  but still keep those autoloaded files in your home directory. These get
  symlinked in when you run `script/bootstrap`.

## install

Run this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mloberg/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
script/bootstrap
```

This will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory.
Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`.

`dot` is a simple script that installs some dependencies, sets sane macOS
defaults, and so on. Tweak this script, and occasionally run `dot` from
time to time to keep your environment fresh and up-to-date. You can find
this script in `bin/`.
